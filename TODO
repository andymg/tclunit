Refactoring Goals:

1. separate GUI from function
1.1. make tclunit event driven, i.e. let users register callbacks/scripts

2. set functionality on top on tcltest, i.e. with interface and behavior
   compatibility (might not be necessary, depends on timing tests)
2.1. check if timing on capturing events produces acceptable results
2.2. do not produce timing information when converting existing tcltest log files

3. dump results as TestNG compatible XML file
3.1. see JUnit.xsd


Synchronous API:
tclunit::runTests path options
tclunit::getResults

Asynchronous API:
tclunit::configure callbacks
tclunit::startTests path options
tclunit::stopTests

Events for callbacks:
<property> name value
<suite> filename
<skipped> testcase reason
<start> testcase
<passed> testcase ?time?
<failed> testcase report ?time?
<status> filename #passed #skipped #failed
<total> #total #passed #skipped #failed ?#time?
<error> filename report


Notes to self:
* stick with tclunit as tunit is as name already taken:
  http://docs.tinyos.net/tinywiki/index.php/TUnit
* clarify license with Bob

Analysis of certain parts on tcltest 2.3.4

* test case output goes into tcltest::outData and tcltest::errData,
  see tcltest::Replace::puts and tcltest::Eval

* original Tcl ::puts resides as tcltest::Replace::Puts

* consider timing a test case to not be around the [test] invocation, as there
  is a lot of magic in this command
  * idea: prepend the -setup and append the -cleanup code - they are uplevel'd
    1, however
  * or wrap tcltest::RunTest if only the body should be timed
  * another problem to consider is if [singleProcess] is false, then the tests
    will run in a second interpreter which explicitly starts the test file

* to capture the actual test result or messages, there is no way around
  wrapping puts, capturing the outputChannel, or a complete rewrite of the
  test command
  * filtering the outputChannel with stack channels is probably the best way,
    emitting sax events along the way
