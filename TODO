Refactoring Goals:

1. separate GUI from function

2. set functionality on top on tcltest, i.e. with interface and behavior
   compatibility

3. dump results as TestNG compatible XML file


Notes to self:
* stick with tclunit as tunit is as name already taken:
  http://docs.tinyos.net/tinywiki/index.php/TUnit
* clarify license with Bob
