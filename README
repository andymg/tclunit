tclunit
=======

tclunit is a not unit testing framework like jUnit. Tcl has tcltest for a long
time providing this sort of functionality. tclunit is more or less sitting on
top of tcltest and provides a way to react on tcltest's logging output.

It comes with two examples that show how to use it:

1. tclunit_gui.tcl

That's a Tk based GUI which lets you run single test scripts, as well as all
tests in a directory. The GUI shows the results in various details.
It is basically the original script, see History below.

2. tclunit_xml.tcl

This script sort of converts the tcltest log into a jUnit compatible XML log
that could, e.g. be used by Jenkins to provide statistics on test suites using
tcltest.

3. tclunit_dom.tcl

Same functionality as above, but requires tDOM.

History

API
---
tclunit::configure event "eventname" script

tclunit::configure interp /path/to/interpreter

tclunit::configure tcltest "list of tcltest::configure options"

tclunit::configure reset

tclunit::run_tests path

tclunit::stop_tests

For the callbacks the registered procedures have to take the following
arguments:

 Event		| Arguments
----------------+-----------
 init		|
 property	| name value
 suite		| filename
 skipped	| filename testcase reason
 start		| filename testcase
 passed		| filename testcase ?time?
 failed		| filename testcase report ?time?
 status		| filename #passed #skipped #failed
 total		| #passed #skipped #failed time
 (error		| filename report) -> not yet implemented

name = the property's name ...
value = ... and its value
filename = the name of the currently running textsuite (could be empty)
testcase = the name of the current testcase
reason = the name of the constraint that caused this test to be skipped
time = execution time of the test/testsuite in milliseconds
report = failure report of tcltest
#passed = number of passed tests (if available)
#skipped = number of skipped tests (if available)
#failed = number of failed tests
